# Readme

The server and client files being used here are modified versions of the Pion examples repository directory called sfu-ws: https://github.com/pion/example-webrtc-applications/tree/master/sfu-ws 

I'm going to come back to this and make a basic but attractive UI, as well as make it as easy to deploy as possible and write up a basic walkthrough for doing so here in the README.

To include in this readme:

-Note about WS heartbeat

-Note about TLS and deployment... (include files in this repo?)

-Walkthrough for nginx, certbot, systemd
